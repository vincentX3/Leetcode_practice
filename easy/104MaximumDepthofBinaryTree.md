# 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:

Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],

 >   3  
 >  / \  
 > 9  20  
 >   /  \  
 >  15   7  
>
return its depth = 3.

## solution
简单递归，暂时没有想出转为stack解决的算法。
